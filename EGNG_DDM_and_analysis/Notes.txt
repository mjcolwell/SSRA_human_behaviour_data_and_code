All modelling was undertaken via Docker image "hcp4715/hddm" on the Docker hub repo.

This will have all required versions of language/package to run the HDDM script. However, keep in mind that running the docker image requires virtualisation which entails a computational bottleneck. You will
need a good computer to run this or there is a high chance of kernel failure. 

If you have any questions, please contact Michael Colwell (michael.colwell@psych.ox.ac.uk).
